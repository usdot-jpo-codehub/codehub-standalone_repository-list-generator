As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly with a probabilistic uncertainty of the data being lost. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency. In TCA 2.3, BSMs and PDMs can also be made to transmit at user-defined intervals.""",OSADP ,Support
